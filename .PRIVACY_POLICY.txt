Dogspotter Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 19th, 2025

Privacy is a fundamental human right, and you deserve to be fully aware of what data is being collected from you, and how it's being used.

1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information:
- Personal Information: When you create an account, we store your username, email address, password (we cannot read it), if you've agreed to our rules, and if you're opted-in to model training.
- Uploaded Content: When you upload a photo, we strip its metadata and then store it on our servers. See section 2 of the terms of service for image ownership information (basically, you still own your image).
- Basic Analytics: We use Posthog to collect information about what pages you navigate to in the app, and limited anonymised events such as when you take, save, or delete a Dogspotter photo.

We use your information to:
- Provide, improve, and personalize the App.
